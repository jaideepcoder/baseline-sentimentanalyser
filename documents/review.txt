Really interesting book..the story line is great and you can easily see whatever is happening, in front of your eyes...the starting is good..i mean really fast pace(which is good and exciting)...one can clearly in his mind see whatever is happening in the lives of the characters.
the detailed description of nearly all the spy agencies of the world is commendable..
when Alec and Elenore are on the run that part is really thrilling.
technologies,escapes , way of execution of a plan is shown brilliantly.
well...the book becomes a little slow in the middle...but i guess that's necessary to build the story....but the again the book comes back to its original pace and is really "unputdownable"...the ending of this book is just Awesome!!! I've never seen this type of climax and ending in any book or even a movie....luved this book..kudos to the writer.
